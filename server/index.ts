/**
 * The test environment's whole server: the built client and a proxy that
 * holds the API key, on one origin.
 *
 * One origin is not cosmetic. The backend answers a CORS preflight with 401
 * and sends no CORS headers at all, so a browser cannot call it directly even
 * with a key — and the key must not be in the browser to begin with. In
 * development the Vite dev server does this job (`vite.config.ts`); a built
 * client has no dev server, which is what this file is for.
 *
 * Run with `node server/index.ts`: Node executes TypeScript by stripping the
 * types, and the repo already forbids the syntax that cannot be stripped
 * (`erasableSyntaxOnly` in tsconfig), so there is no build step and no
 * compiled copy to keep in step with the source.

 * A long answer streams for 30–90 seconds, and a turn against a slow corpus
 * has gone past two minutes. Node's own defaults are above that — 300 s for
 * a request, no socket timeout at all — and these two lines say so out loud
 * rather than leaving the next reader to look it up. `headersTimeout` stays
 * short: waiting for headers is not waiting for an answer.
