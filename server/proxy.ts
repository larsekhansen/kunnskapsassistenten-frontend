/**
 * Where the call is actually going, or undefined when that is outside `/api/`.

 * The prefix has to be checked on the address the fetch will use, not on the
 * string the browser sent, and those are not the same string. The URL parser
 * removes dot segments — `/api/../console-api/x` becomes `/console-api/x`,
 * and `%2e%2e` counts as `..` to it — so a `startsWith('/api/')` on the raw
 * request passed happily while the call landed on the console API with this
 * server's key attached. Found by KA CC on #151.
 *
 * Built by concatenating rather than resolving against a base, so a backend
 * address that carries a path of its own keeps it: `new URL('/api/mcp',
 * 'https://host/rag')` throws the `/rag` away, and the string does not.
 *
 * The checks after it are all one idea: a path whose meaning depends on how
 * the BACKEND decodes it is a path this server does not get to reason about,
 * so it refuses it. Measured shapes, all of which survive normalisation here
 * and may or may not escape `/api/` over there (KA CC on #151):
 *
 * | sendt | etter parsing | hva backend kan gjøre av det |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `/api/..%2fauth` | `/api/..%2fauth` | dekoder `%2f` → `/api/../auth` |
 * | `/api/..;/auth` | `/api/..;/auth` | stryker `;`-parameter → `/api/../auth` |
 * | `/api/%252e%252e/auth` | `/api/%252e%252e/auth` | dekoder to ganger → `/api/../auth` |
 * | `/api/....//auth` | `/api/....//auth` | stryker `../` én gang → `/api/../auth` |
 *
 * This is a blocklist, and a blocklist is the weaker kind. An allowlist on the
 * segment alphabet would be stronger and is not available: the ids in these
 * paths are the backend's — `5G7i1YoIdX432vrCDLrwk` today — and we do not get
 * to decide what characters it may mint tomorrow. What is refused here is
 * therefore the shapes, and none of them is a shape a real path has: no
 * address we call carries a semicolon, a double-encoded escape, a segment of
 * nothing but dots, or an empty segment in the middle.
