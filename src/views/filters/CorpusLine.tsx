 * What the reader is searching, on one line.

 * The whole sentence — «Dokumenter fra Kudos: 938 dokumenter, årsrapporter,
 * …» — wrapped to two lines in a 327 px panel and took 63 px of a filter head
 * that measured 179 at 1440. The panel is over its height budget, and this is
 * N2 in hoydebudsjett-forslag-2026-09-21: keep the name, put the rest behind
 * «Vis mer».
 *
 * The name is the right half to keep, and that follows from #103 and #106
 * rather than from taste: it is the half that CHANGES when a reader switches
 * corpus, and the half that says where the answers come from (brukerreiser
 * punkt 11). What is inside a corpus is the same sentence every time it is
 * read.
 *
 * A button with `aria-expanded` rather than `Details`: a `Details` summary is
 * a block and would start its own line, which is the 32 px this exists to
 * save. The button sits at the end of the name's line instead, and the detail
 * opens under it.
 *
 * The state is not remembered — deliberately, and it is in the brief. A
 * reader who opened it once has read it; reopening the panel tomorrow starts
 * from the short line again, which is the line the height budget assumes.

              A `Link` around a `button`, and both halves are deliberate.

              The button is the semantics: this opens something on the page,
              it is not a place to go, and `aria-expanded` belongs on a
              button. The link is the size: Designsystemet's `Button` is
              42 px tall at `data-size="sm"` against a 21 px line of text, so
              a real button set the height of the row and ate most of what
              this change exists to save (measured: head 158 px with it,
              139 without). `Link` draws text, so the control is as tall as
              the line it sits on — and quieter beside a small muted sentence
              than a filled grey button was.

              Nothing of Designsystemet's is overridden to get there; the link
              styles and the focus ring come from the component.
