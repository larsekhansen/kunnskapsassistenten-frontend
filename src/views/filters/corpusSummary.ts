 * 2026-09-15, punkt 11, retningslinje 6).
 *
 * Everything in the sentence is read off the facets, so it follows the corpus
 * instead of being a claim someone has to remember to update. The facets have
 * to be the unconditional ones for that to hold: a count narrowed by the
 * user's own selection would make the line say the corpus shrank when all
 * that happened was that they ticked a box.
 *
 * Every clause is optional and drops out when the data behind it is missing.
 * Live mode has no facet aggregation at all (API-bestilling A2), so there the
 * line is the corpus's own words: its description from the environment, or
 * its name when it has none. «Kudos» was the constant here until a reader
 * could choose the corpus (#106) — it is now whatever is being searched, and
 * «standardkorpuset» when nothing names it.
