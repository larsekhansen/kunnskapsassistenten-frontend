 * What to say about an upload that did not work, in Norwegian.
 *
 * One table for two places, and that is the point. A refused file in the list
 * and a drop zone that is switched off in live mode are the same four causes
 * — `useUserDocuments` reports both as an {@link UploadErrorCode} for exactly
 * this reason (asked for by #2, 21.09) — and two tables would drift into
 * saying different things about one cause.
 *
 * `unavailable` is not a failure the reader caused or can retry: there is no
 * upload endpoint at all (API-bestilling A3). It says so instead of «noe gikk
 * galt», which would send them off looking for a mistake they did not make.

 * reader is told has to be the number the check uses. {@link fileSize} counts
 * in decimal units like a file manager does, and would call the same limit
 * «21 MB» — true, and two different numbers for one rule.
