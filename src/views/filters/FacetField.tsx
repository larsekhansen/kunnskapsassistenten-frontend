 * clear and toggle buttons get Norwegian names. Everything u-combobox writes
 * for the selected values stays English — the chip container is announced as
 * «Selected», the input's `aria-description` as «No selected», and a chip as
 * «…, Press to remove». In a service that has to be Norwegian all the way
 * into the accessible names, that is a defect, not a detail.
 *
 * `data-sr-*` is u-combobox's own override: the keys are its observed
 * attributes, and an empty value falls back to the English default. See
 * @u-elements/u-combobox, `TEXTS` and `observedAttributes`.

 * Designsystemet's Suggestion with `multiple`, decided by Lars. Three things
 * are worth knowing about it, all from design/designsystemet/suggestion.md:
 *
 *   1. Selected values render as chips inside the field. That is the chip
 *      requirement (answer 50) already satisfied, so we do not add a second
 *      row of Chip.Removable — showing both would show every filter twice.
 *   2. The list is locked to the width of the input by an inline style unless
 *      `data-overscroll="contain"` turns that off. It does, and the width
 *      then has to come from our own CSS. The design draws the list wider
 *      than the field, and the labels here are long enough to need it.
 *   3. `autoPlacement` is a dead prop in 1.21.0 — destructured and never
 *      used. `data-autoplacement` is the attribute that works.
 *
 * Suggestion.Clear only clears the text the user has typed, not the
 * selection: u-combobox hides it whenever the input is empty. «Tøm» is
 * therefore our own button, which is also what answer 50 asks for.

   * the Figma sketch does with «Alle valgt», and it breaks the promise a
   * label makes to a screen reader user — the name has to stay put.
   *
   * Three states, three sentences. «Alle valgt» used to cover both an
   * untouched field and one where the user had picked every value, which made
   * the two word for word identical: the reader could not tell whether a
   * filter was set, and «Velg alle» offered an action whose result the text
