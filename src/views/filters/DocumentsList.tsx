/**
 * The documents from Kudos that the answer on screen builds on.

 * This and {@link OwnDocuments} were one component, drawn as one column at
 * the foot of the panel, because that is where Figma draws them. In a panel
 * that scrolls they ended up under the window edge: measured at 1440 × 900
 * with an answer on screen, the first row started at y = 818 in a 900 px
 * window, under the corpus line and three facet fields (brukerblikk runde 2,
 * funn 4). What changes with every answer sat below what changes rarely.
 *
 * So the two halves are separate components now, and the view puts this one
 * above the facets. They were only together because they shared a heading;
 * splitting costs that grouping and buys a list the reader can see. See
 * FiltersView for the ordering and why it does not touch answer 1.
 *
 * Two deliberate omissions against the Figma frame:
 *
 *   «Velg dokumenter» is drawn greyed out in the empty state. A disabled
 *   button is not reachable by keyboard and says nothing about why, and
 *   Designsystemet's own JSDoc advises against it, so the button is simply
 *   not rendered until there is something to choose between. The sentence
 *   under «Fra Kudos» already explains the state. It is not built in the
 *   active state either: the frame never draws a selected row, so there is
 *   no state for it to put the list into (answers 8 and 9).
 *
 *   The upload zone is drawn as a drop target with a button. Upload does not
 *   exist anywhere in the stack (API-bestilling A3), and question 9 is still
 *   open, so this is text, not a control. A dashed box that looks droppable
 *   but drops nothing is worse than a sentence that says so.
