 * a working `aria-label` on the cross («Tøm», Norwegian by default) and the
 * correct `type='search'` semantics. `Search.Clear` is `type='reset'`, which
 * is why there is a real `<form>` around it.
 *
 * Previous/next move up and down through a vertical text, not sideways through
 * pages, so this is not `Pagination` — `search-excerpts.md` makes the same
 * point.
 *
 * The counter is a live region. Without it the search is silent for a screen
 * reader user: `<mark>` is not announced, so «1 av 26 treff» is the only thing
 * that says the search did anything.

  // is what makes it inert, since the browser still delivers the event.
