 * What the sources view needs from whoever mounts it.

 * It is `SlotViewProps` plus the sources. The slot props are partial so the
 * view also renders on its own, outside the shell, which is what the preview
 * harness does; a component with partial props is still assignable to
 * `ComponentType<SlotViewProps>`, so the shell can mount it unchanged.
 *
 * The shell owns the collapse button and hides the whole view with `hidden`
 * when the slot is collapsed, so nothing here has to draw a «Vis kilder»
 * button. `collapsed` is still read: a collapsed panel should not scroll
 * itself to a citation it cannot show.
 *
 * `activeCitationNumber` and `activeCitationNonce` come from `useCitation()`
 * through the shell. The nonce is what makes a second click on the same `[n]`
 * count as a new request (answer 19).
