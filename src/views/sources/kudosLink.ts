/**
 * What the link out to Kudos can honestly promise.
 *
 * Measured against kudos.dfo.no on 2026-09-16 (see
 * `design/kudos-lenker-og-usikre-2026-09-16.md`):
 *
 * - `https://kudos.dfo.no/dokument/<uuid>` is a landing page with the
 *   document's summary. It has no PDF viewer — no `iframe`, `embed` or
 *   `object` — and no per-page anchors, so no fragment on it scrolls
 *   anywhere. `#side-41` and `#page=41` both land at the top.
 * - The PDF itself is a separate address,
 *   `https://kudos.dfo.no/dokument/<uuid>/filer/<fil-uuid>.pdf`, served as
 *   `application/pdf` with `content-disposition: inline`. The browser's own
 *   viewer opens it and honours `#page=N` (PDF Open Parameters).
 *
 * So «Les side 41 på Kudos» is only true when the address is the file with
 * `#page=41` on it. Anywhere else the link opens the document at the top, and
 * that is what the label should say. The page number is not lost by this: the
 * excerpt prints «side 41» above the quote either way.
 *
 * The rule is written as a question about the address rather than a flag from
 * the data on purpose — the day the backend starts handing out file URLs, the
 * label upgrades itself with no further change here.

/** True when this address opens the named page, not just the document. */

/**
 * The link text for an excerpt's «read it at the source» link.
 *
 * The corpus is named rather than written in, for the same reason the
 * disclaimer names it: «Les dokumentet på Kudos» over a NorQuAD article is
 * the same false sentence KA CC measured on the line above it (bør on #129).
 * The name is the answer's corpus, so it does not change under a reader who
 * moves the chooser while an old thread is open.
 *
 * The page half stays as it was. That is about the shape of the address and
 * not about whose corpus it is: only a file URL with `#page=N` opens a page,
 * whoever serves it, and anything else honestly says «dokumentet».
