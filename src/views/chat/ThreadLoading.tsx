 * The conversation at the address, while it is being read.
 *
 * What stood here was the front page: «Hei 👋 Hva lurer du på?» and three
 * suggestions, on a route that names a conversation the reader has already
 * chosen — while the filter panel beside it drew skeletons and said it was
 * loading (brukerblikk 8, funn 2). The waiting was never the problem; the
 * greeting was. A reader who opened a thread is not being welcomed to a new
 * one, and three suggestions are an offer to start over.
 *
 * So the shape of what is coming stands here instead: one question and one
 * answer. It is the same skeleton the answer being written uses, because it
 * is the same promise — text is on its way to this spot.
 *
 * Hidden from a screen reader, which cannot read a shape, and the `output`
 * says in words what the lines say in grey. It sits outside the hidden part,
 * or it would be hidden with it.
 *
 * The compose field stays. A question asked while this is on screen belongs
 * to the thread in the address and is filed under it (#149, #153), and the
 * stored conversation lays itself in front of the turn when it lands.
