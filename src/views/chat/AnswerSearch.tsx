/**
 * Search inside one answer (design/brukerreiser-2026-09-15.md, punkt 13).
 *
 * The sources panel has had a search with a hit counter and previous/next
 * since PR #26, and the answer beside it had nothing — so a reader looking for
 * one number in a long answer had the browser's own find or nothing. This is
 * the same control, in the answer's action row, and deliberately the same
 * shape: `Search` with `Search.Clear`, a live counter, «Forrige» and «Neste»
 * that stop at the ends rather than wrapping (brukerblikk 2026-09-15, funn
 * 11), and `aria-disabled` rather than `disabled` so stepping never drops the
 * keyboard out of the control.
 *
 * It does not take Ctrl+F. The browser's find is the one keyboard shortcut
 * every reader already has, and a page that swallows it takes away a working
 * tool to offer its own — the brief asks for an alternative to it, not a
 * replacement. Escape closes, which is what a reader expects of a strip that
 * opened over what they were reading.
 *
 * The counter is a live region for the same reason as in the sources panel:
 * `<mark>` is not announced, so «2 av 7 treff» is the only thing that tells a
 * screen reader user the search did anything.
