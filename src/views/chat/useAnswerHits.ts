/**
 * The search hits inside one rendered answer: how many, and which one the
 * reader is standing on.
 *
 * Counted from the DOM rather than from the markdown, and that is the whole
 * idea. `Markdown` renders an answer through react-markdown, so the text the
 * reader sees is not the string that went in: headings lose their `#`, bold
 * loses its stars, a `[3]` becomes a link. Counting matches in the markdown
 * source would give a number that does not match the highlights on screen —
 * and the counter's only job is to describe those highlights.
 *
 * So `Markdown` marks every match, purely and in document order, and this
 * reads them back with `querySelectorAll`, which returns them in exactly that
 * order. Reading order is a question about the rendered document, and the
 * rendered document is what answers it.
 *
 * The current hit is marked with a `data-current` attribute set here rather
 * than rendered, because which mark is current is a fact about the rendered
 * order and not about any one block of markdown.
 *
 * Which is why it is re-applied after EVERY render and not only when the
 * index changes. Measured in the browser 2026-09-15: stepping to hit 2 set
 * the attribute, and it was gone a moment later. The chat view re-renders on
 * scroll — `useAtBottom` watches the main column — and the smooth scroll to
 * the hit is itself scrolling, so the render that followed took the attribute
 * with it while the effect that sets it sat still on unchanged dependencies.
 * Scrolling is the one thing that stays behind a dependency list: an effect
 * that scrolled on every render would take the page away from a reader who
 * had just scrolled it themselves.
