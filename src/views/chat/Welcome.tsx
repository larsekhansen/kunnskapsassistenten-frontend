 * What a reader meets before the first question: a greeting and three
 * suggestions.
 *
 * Not the shared `EmptyState` from src/components: that one says «there is
 * nothing here». This one is the start of a conversation, and it is the
 * fullest screen in the flow rather than the emptiest.
 *
 * The greeting is two lines in Figma, «Hei, Simen 👋» and «Hva lurer du på?».
 * Without a name the first line would read «Hei,  👋», so it falls back to a
 * plain «Hei 👋». The waving hand is decorative — a screen reader announcing
 * «vinkende hånd» in the middle of a greeting adds nothing — so it is hidden
 * and the greeting is a real heading either way.
 *
 * Both lines are ONE heading with a break between them, which is how Figma
 * draws it: a single text node holding two lines. Making the second line a
 * heading of its own put an entry in the outline with nothing under it, next
 * to the «Forslag» heading that does name something.
