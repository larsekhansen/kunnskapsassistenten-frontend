   * The thread can arrive after the view has mounted, and usually does:
   * `ChatSlotView` draws the chat straight away and fills `thread` in when
   * the client answers, so on `/threads/:id` this hook starts with no
   * messages and the conversation lands a moment later.
   *
   * It used to land by remounting — the view keyed itself on the thread id,
   * so `undefined → id` replaced the whole session. That is how the restored
   * conversation got in, and it is also why anything the reader had typed
   * while it loaded was thrown away with it, and why CI went red on main
   * (the remount fell in the middle of a test's keystrokes; two different
   * assertions, one cause). So the messages are adopted instead.
   *
   * A reader who has already asked something at this address keeps what they
   * asked. The stored conversation is laid in FRONT of it rather than instead
   * of it: both are real, and the order is the one they happened in — the
   * saved turns are older than the question asked while they loaded.
   *
   * It used to be dropped outright (`if (messages.length === 0)`), which is
   * the hole KA CC found in #66: ask something on `/threads/:id` before
   * `getThread` answers, and the conversation that was already there never
   * arrived. Only the turn in flight was protected, and protecting it did not
   * require throwing the rest away.
   *
   * By id, so nothing lands twice. The live turn and the stored one can be
   * the same turn — the mock writes a finished answer into the store under
   * the id it just streamed (`recordMockTurn`), so a thread that resolves
   * after the answer settled carries it back. What is already on screen wins;
   * only ids the conversation has not seen are prepended.
   *
   * Adjusted while rendering the change rather than in an effect, which is
   * React's own answer to «a prop changed and state has to follow»: an effect
   * would draw the empty conversation once first.
   *
   * Compared on what the messages ARE and not on the identity of the array
   * that carries them. `initialMessages` has a default of `[]`, which is a
   * fresh array on every call, so a reference check said «a new thread» every
   * render and looped. Length plus the last id is enough: a thread that has
   * grown or been replaced differs, and the same thread handed over twice
   * does not.
