/**
 * The conversation.
 *
 * An ordered list, because the order is the meaning: message four answers
 * message three. Who said what is carried by text, not by colour or by which
 * side a bubble sits on — a screen reader user gets neither.
 *
 * The sender line is a visually hidden span rather than a heading. The answer
 * brings its own headings from the model, and a heading per message on top of
 * those would give the page two competing outlines.
 *
 * It also owns which answer the search strip belongs to, and that is not a
 * detail of bookkeeping. The strip is drawn in the shell's view-head, pinned
 * to the top of the column, and a region has one of those — so «which answer
 * is being searched» is a fact about the conversation and cannot live inside
 * each answer. Before it moved, every answer held its own and two could be
 * open at once; now opening one closes the other, which is also what a single
 * pinned strip looks like to a reader.
 *
 * Three kinds of turn, and this file is the choice between them. A question
 * is a paragraph. A turn that came back as `needs-clarification` is a question
 * to the reader and not an answer, so the sender line says «spurte» and the
 * card is `Clarification`. Everything else is an answer, and `AnswerMessage`
 * draws it — it holds state of its own, which is why it is a component and
 * not another branch in here.
