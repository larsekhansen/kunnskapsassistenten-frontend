 *
 * Copying takes the sources with it. An answer pasted into a submission
 * without its provenance is the one thing KA is not for (reise 13, 14 and 20
 * in design/brukerreiser-2026-09-15.md), so the markers stay and a reference
 * list follows them. The receipt counts what went along, because «Svaret er
 * kopiert» would not tell the reader that anything more did.
 *
 * The receipt under the row is rendered empty rather than hidden while there
 * is nothing to say. A live region that is `display: none` is not in the
 * accessibility tree, so the region and its text would appear in the same
 * frame and announce nothing — the same rule
 * `src/components/ErrorState.tsx` is built around.
 *
 * A clarification has its own, shorter row: see `Clarification.tsx`.
