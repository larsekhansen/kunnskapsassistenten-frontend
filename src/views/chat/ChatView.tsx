        See src/components/ErrorState.tsx.

        Heading, text and whether there is a button at all come from the code
        (errorText.ts). A rejected key gets no «Prøv igjen»: the same question
        with the same key fails the same way, and a button that cannot work
        sends the reader round the loop instead of towards whoever can fix it.

/**
 * The chat: the greeting, the conversation and the compose field.
 *
 * Mounted in the `main` slot by the shell. It is a view, so it is named after
 * its content and could sit in another slot the day the layout lets a reader
 * move it. It expects the route around it to carry the page's level 1
 * heading, as Figma draws it: «Kunnskapsassistenten» on top, the thread title
 * under it.
 *
 * **It does not key itself.** It used to: `key={props.thread?.id ?? 'new'}`,
 * so that moving between threads started from that thread's messages instead
 * of carrying the previous conversation across. The trouble is that `thread`
 * is undefined until the client has answered, so on `/threads/:id` the key
 * went `'new'` → the id a moment after mount, and the session remounted with
 * everything the compose field was holding. Type while the thread is loading
 * and the text was gone. In CI, which is slower, the remount landed in the
 * middle of a test's keystrokes and `chat.spec` went red on main.
 *
 * The remount it was for already happens above: `ChatSlotView` renders
 * `<ChatSlot key={threadId}>` off the route, so a real thread change replaces
 * this whole subtree, and the preview passes a key of its own. Keying here as
 * well only added the one transition the route never makes — from «no thread»
 * to «this thread» — which is not a change of conversation at all. It is the
 * same conversation arriving.
 *
 * Which is also why the route is not read here instead: a view takes a
 * `ThreadDetail` and never a route (see slotViews/ChatSlotView.tsx), and the
 * caller that knows the address is already doing the job.
