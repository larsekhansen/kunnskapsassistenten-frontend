/**
 * The `h2` over a conversation: the thread title, and whether it is worth
 * looking at.
 *
 * The same conversation looked like two different pages depending on how the
 * reader got there: `/threads/:id` drew the thread title as an `h2` with the
 * question under it, `/` drew no heading at all, so the first heading in the
 * column was the answer's own `h3` (brukerblikk 2026-09-15, finding 5). The
 * head is the same on both routes now.
 *
 * Until a thread has a title of its own, the first sentence of the first
 * question stands in. That title is the question again, and the question is
 * right under it, so the conductor settled it on 2026-09-15: a title that
 * only repeats the question is visually hidden. The heading stays in the
 * document, so the outline a screen reader walks is the same on both routes
 * and in both states; it is the second copy on screen that goes. A real title
 * — from the backend, or generated later from more than the first sentence —
 * is shown with the question under it, as Figma draws it.
 *
 * Whether a title is the question over again is the thread's own answer, not
 * something guessed from the text: `titleFromQuestion` is set by whoever made
 * the title (`threadFromQuestion` in src/model/thread.ts), and it stores the
 * whole question rather than a first sentence, so comparing the two strings
 * would say «different» for any question of more than one sentence. A thread
 * that carries no flag is one nobody has claimed to have named after the
 * question, and the stand-in below is ours and always is.
 *
 * The stand-in is a label rather than a sentence, so it loses the question
 * mark or full stop the question ended on, the way the titles it replaces are
 * written («Regnskap og bevilgning i DSS sine årsrapporter», «Digdir:
 * tildelingsbrev mot årsrapport»).
