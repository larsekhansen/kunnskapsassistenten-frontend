 *
 * One line, always, with an ellipsis (Lars, 23.09). `Thread.title` is the
 * reader's own question until a backend writes a real title, so an untitled
 * thread was the one row that took two lines where «NKOM måloppnåelse» took
 * one. The whole title stays in the DOM and is read by a screen reader; what
 * is cut is only what is drawn.
 *
 * What is cut comes back on hover and on focus, as a box that may hang over
 * the panel's edge — see {@link RowOverlay}. It replaces the `title`
 * attribute the row used to carry: a native tooltip cannot be styled, cannot
 * hold the metadata line, and is read as a description after the name a

 * top-left corner and painted in the row's hover surface and radius, so it
 * reads as the row growing rather than as a second thing appearing elsewhere.
 *

 *   The listener is on the document because the pointer may be what opened
 *   it, and then nothing in the row has focus to catch a key.
 *   Persistent — it stays until the pointer leaves the row, focus leaves it,
 *   or Escape. Nothing times it out.
 *   Hoverable — the box takes the pointer, and the row treats the two as one
 *   surface: a move from the row onto the box is not a leave, and neither is
 *   the way back. It had `pointer-events: none` until KA CC measured #160:
 *   the part that hangs past the panel edge is NOT over the row, so the
 *   pointer going there ended the hover and shut the box the reader was
 *   reading.
 *
 * It is anchored to a place in the window rather than to the row, so a scroll
 * or a resize moves the row out from under it. Both close it.
