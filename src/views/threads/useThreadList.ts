 * (measured by KA CC on #63). The list is a view of the same conversations
 * the chat view is writing, so it has to re-read them when they change.

 * something changed — see `conversationRevision` below — so a refresh happens

 *   thread. That thread is in the store before the shell is told, so a read
 *   that follows this change sees it.
 *
 *   The answers that have stopped streaming, which is when a turn has been
 *   written down and the thread's `updatedAt` has moved. Streaming answers
 *   are deliberately left out: the row would be re-read once per token and
 *   nothing about it would differ.
 *
 * The sources are used as a clock rather than as data — the list draws none
 * of them. It is the only thing the shell holds that moves when an answer
 * lands, and `answers` is the honest half of it: it carries one entry per
 * answer with its status, so it says «a turn settled» without the list having
 * to know anything about what was in it. If the chat view ever stops
 * reporting its answers this stops ticking, and the list would then want a
 * signal of its own from the shell.
