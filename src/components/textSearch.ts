/**
 * Finding a string in a piece of text, and saying where it was found.
 *
 * Lars asked for **one** search mechanism, not two (answers 27 and 55): the
 * sources panel searches excerpts today, the answer and whole documents are
 * next. That is why this is not «excerpt search» — it knows nothing about
 * excerpts, documents or sources. It takes a flat list of pieces of text with
 * an id each, and gives back where the matches are.
 *
 * What stays with the caller is what the pieces ARE.
 * `buildSearchIndex` in src/views/sources/search.ts turns documents into
 * items, because only that view knows what a document is. The day the chat
 * view searches an answer it writes its own three lines and reuses
 * everything here.
 *
 * Moved out of the sources view 2026-09-15 at #3's request, unchanged: the
 * matching, the counter and the previous/next navigation were already general,
 * and the only thing holding them in one view was the folder they sat in.
