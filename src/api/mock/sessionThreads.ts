/**
 * The conversations this browser tab has had, so a reload does not lose them.
 *
 * Reise 12 and 14 in design/brukerreiser-2026-09-15.md, punkt 16 on the
 * ranked list — the worst journey in the app: ask a question on `/`, get an
 * address, reload, and the conversation is gone while the address still looks
 * like it means something. The backend cannot fix it yet (gap 4: a
 * `conversation_id` from `tools/call` is not readable back through
 * `/api/conversations`, API-bestilling A6), so the mock does what a backend
 * with a thread API would do, and the live client keeps saying the truth.
 *
 * `sessionStorage` and not `localStorage`, on purpose. This is a stand-in for
 * a server, not a record: it lives as long as the tab, it is not shared with
 * other tabs, and it goes away when the browser is closed — which is the
 * honest lifetime for something that exists because the real store is
 * missing. It also means a fixture corpus cannot slowly fill a reader's disk
 * with answers they never asked to keep.
 *
 * Only the turns produced HERE are stored. A fixture thread the reader asked
 * a follow-up in keeps its fixture messages in code and gets the new turn
 * appended on read, so the same answer is never written down twice.
 *
 * Every access is guarded the same way the colour scheme is: storage throws
 * outright in Safari's private mode and with site data blocked, and the quota
 * is finite. A remembered conversation is never worth a blank page, so a bad
 * or full store simply means the app behaves as it did before this existed.

 * emptying it.
 *
 * `certainty` is the caller saying how much of the thread is real. The shell
 * can open one before it has read it — a question asked while `/threads/:id`
 * is still loading has to be filed somewhere — and then it is sure of the id
 * and stands in for the rest. A stand-in only makes sure there is somewhere
 * to file the answer; it never writes over what is already here, and it never
 * keeps the real thread from landing a moment later.
 *
 * Told rather than worked out. Keeping whatever was written FIRST looks like
 * the same rule and is not: in that one gap it is the stand-in that writes
 * first, so the conversation would have ended up named after the newest
 * question asked in it, with the real title arriving 700 ms too late to get in
 * (KA CC on #153).
