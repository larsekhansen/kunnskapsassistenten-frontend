/**
 * Who the backend thinks is asking, until there is a login.
 *
 * `/api/conversations` refuses a request without `X-User-Id` (400) and lists
 * only the conversations whose `conversation/user-id` equals it. There is no
 * sign-in anywhere in this app yet, so the id is one we make up and keep: a
 * random value in `localStorage` under `ka.user.v1`.
 *
 * **This is a stand-in, not an identity.** It is not a secret and it proves
 * nothing — anyone holding the API key can pass any id and read that user's
 * conversations, because the backend checks the header against the stored
 * value and nothing else. It exists so that one browser sees its own threads
 * and not every thread the key has ever created. The day there is a real
 * login, the id comes from there and this file goes away. Written up in
 * README under «Live-modus».
 *
 * The version in the key is there for the day the shape changes: a stored id
 * that no longer means what it meant is a new key, not a migration.

 * The id for this browser, made on first use.

 * Held in a module variable as well as in storage, and that is the case that
 * matters rather than a saving: `localStorage` throws in a private window and

 * reader clears it. Without the fallback every question would be a new user
 * and the thread list would be empty every time. With it, the session at
 * least agrees with itself.
