/**
 * The upload client against a backend that has no upload.
 *
 * **It calls nothing.** There is no endpoint — API-bestilling A3 — and a
 * client that POSTed somewhere hopeful would turn a known gap into a 404 the
 * reader has to interpret. It refuses immediately, with the one code that
 * means «not you, and not worth retrying»: `unavailable`.
 *
 * The refusal is a document with `status: 'failed'` rather than a throw, for
 * the reason the interface gives: the file has to appear in the list saying
 * why, or the reader is left with a picker that seems to do nothing.
 *
 * It still reads the file NAME to type it, so the refusal is the honest one
 * even in live mode: a `.png` is refused for being a `.png`, and only a file
 * we would otherwise have taken is refused for the missing endpoint. A reader
 * who gets «støtter ikke dette filformatet» for a PDF would go looking for
 * the wrong problem.
 *
 * `list` is empty and `remove` does nothing, both truthfully: nothing was
 * ever stored anywhere, so there is nothing to list and nothing to take away.
