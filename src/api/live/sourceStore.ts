 * What each answer was built from and how, kept in this browser, so the
 * sources and «Fremgangsmåte» come back when the page is loaded again
 * (Simens runde 3, ekstra 2, and Simens issue 88; docs/arkitektur/0005).
 *
 * The backend keeps the answer's text and nothing else: a thread read back
 * has `chunks: []` on every message (headless-rag #21), and no steps at all.
 * So the one record of them is what the live answer carried, and this is
 * where it is written down.
 *
 * Only what the answer itself carried is kept. For the chunks: the id, the
 * document's number, its title, its address and the heading path. No passage
 * from any document is written to the browser; the text is looked up again
 * from the same route a fresh answer uses (excerpts.ts), so a fresh answer and
 * one read back cannot show two texts for one chunk. For the steps: what the
 * stream said, which is the agent's own words about what it did, the search
 * strings it ran, the numbers of hits and documents, and how long it thought.
 *
 * Keyed by the conversation and by the answer's text, because nothing else
 * survives: the live stream names its answer `msg-<time>`, and the store gives
 * the same answer an id of its own. The stored text was measured to be the
 * text `tools/call` returned, character for character (30.09, one answer).
 *
 * Everything here fails quietly. Storage that is full, blocked or corrupt
 * leaves the reader where they were before this existed — sources gone after
 * a reload — and never costs them an answer.
