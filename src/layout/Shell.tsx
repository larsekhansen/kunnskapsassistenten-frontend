   *      the sources panel's search field.
   *   2. The toggle button itself is REPLACED when the slot collapses or
   *      opens: collapsed it is wrapped in a Tooltip, and a wrapper appearing
   *      around an element is a different element to React, so the old button
   *      is unmounted and a new one mounted. The user pressed that button and
   *      the DOM node they were standing on stops existing. Measured
   *      2026-09-15, when the rail wrapped it for the first time.
   *
   * Either way the next Tab would start again at the skip link, a whole page
   * away from what the user was doing. WCAG 2.4.3.
   *
   * The repair is the move CONTRIBUTING asks of any control that disappears
   * by its own action: send focus to what the action left behind, which here
   * is the toggle button in its new state.
   *
   * This sits in the slot rather than in the provider on purpose. The provider
   * knows WHY a panel closed; only the slot knows whether it was holding the
   * focus, and that is the only question the repair turns on. Written this way

        An icon button with its name in `aria-label`, in every state.

        It used to draw the words beside the icon while the panel was open, on
        the argument that a label on screen beats one behind a hover. That was
        right while the row held one control. It stopped being right when the
        row had to hold three: «Skjul tråder og filter» (209 px) beside
        «Tråder» (123) and the two width buttons (88) is 420 px in a 400 px
        panel, and what fell off the end was the width buttons — a control the
        pointer could no longer reach at all. Measured by KA CC on #119.

        Nothing is lost for a screen reader: the name is the same string it
        always was, and `aria-label` is what carries it. What a sighted reader
        loses is the word on screen; what they get back is two controls that
        are on screen at all. The tooltip says the same string on hover and on
        focus.

        Both sidebars and not only the one that overflowed: it is the same
        row, and a panel head that read differently in the two would be two
        designs for one thing.

        design/designsystemet/komponenter/tooltip.md.

        That package ALSO reads `data-tooltip` into an accessible name — it
        writes `aria-label` when the element has no text and `aria-description`
        when it has (`tooltip.ts:83-84`), so a collapsed rail button would get
        its name from the tooltip whether or not we set one.

        The explicit `aria-label` on the button stays anyway, and not as belt
        and braces: it is the name from first render, while the web package's
        MutationObserver only gets there a tick later, and it is the name even
        if that package never loads — it is an indirect dependency, pulled in
        by whichever Designsystemet component happens to import it. Both
        strings are the same, so the two never disagree.

        1440, taking «Skjul kilder» to y = −955 — a screen above the top of the

        The separator has to be inside the landmark — content outside every
        landmark is an axe `region` violation, and a control a reader can
        reach is content (KA CC, measured on four routes after #50). It cannot
        be inside THIS box: `overflow: hidden` would cut its focus ring off,
        and the scrolling region below it puts a scrollbar exactly where the
        grip goes. So the landmark holds both, and this element is what makes
        that possible.

        Designsystemet's own `Dialog` with `placement` set to the edge this
        slot stands at — the component has a drawer mode, checked against the
        1.21.0 export list and written up in
        design/designsystemet/behov-til-komponent.md. `modal` is its default,
        so this is a native `showModal()`: the browser traps the focus, makes
        everything outside it `inert`, answers Escape, and returns the focus
        to whatever opened it — the rail button. Four of the things this had
        to do, none of them ours to write. WCAG 2.4.3.

        `onClose` fires only when the USER closed it — Escape or the close
        button — and not when React closed it by setting `open` to false. So
        this is the one direction that has to be told back to the provider,
        and it cannot loop: the state it sets is the state the dialog is
        already in.

        Rendered whether open or shut, and a shut `<dialog>` is `display:
        none`, so nothing inside it is reachable or in the accessibility tree.
        It stays mounted so the view inside keeps its state across an open and
        a close.

        An open panel is not on its own enough — the separator drops itself
        when the WINDOW has no room to give either, which is the state at
        1440 with both sidebars open. That test needs the width range, so it
        lives in the component rather than here. Same for the width buttons
        above. See PanelSeparator.tsx.

        than beside it, and there is nothing between them to move.
