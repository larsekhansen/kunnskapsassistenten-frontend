/**
 * The view model for the layout: slots, views, and which view sits where.
 *
 * Naming follows the rule Lars set on 2026-09-11 (design/_briefs/bygg/regler.md):
 * code is English, everything the user sees or hears is Norwegian. Slots are
 * named after position, views after content — the same split VS Code makes.
 *
 *   Slot   a place in the layout. Fixed, three of them.
 *   View   content that can be moved between slots.
 *
 * A slot never carries a fixed accessible name. The name comes from the views
 * that currently sit in it, which is why `slotLabel()` derives it. Moving
 * SourcesView into the primary sidebar must move its name with it, otherwise
 * the accessible name lies to a screen reader user.
 *
 * This file is the abstraction only (answers 10 and 48 in
 * design/skal-dette-implementeres.md). There is deliberately no UI for
 * switching layouts, no drag handles and no persistence yet. The abstraction
 * comes first because slot content, slot width and the mode switching in both
 * sidebars are the same problem; solved once, four open questions disappear.
 * LayoutProvider holds the state and the operations a future UI would call.

 *
 *   42  the toggle button once it is icon-only. Designsystemet draws a
 *       `data-size="sm"` Button with `icon` as a 42 px square — that is
 *       `min-inline-size: 42px`, border included. Measured in the built app,
 *       2026-09-15, not taken from the token scale.
 *   +24 `--ds-size-3` on each side, so the button sits clear of both edges.
 *   + 1 the rail's own border against the answer column. `box-sizing:
 *       border-box` takes it out of the content box, and forgetting that term
 *       is exactly what made 232 draw a two-line label on 2026-09-14.

 * open, can both produce.
 *
 * Somebody has to give, and the order is the decision of 2026-09-14 (option A
 * in design/visjon-og-beslutninger.md) with the drag handle's addition:
 *
 *   1. the answer column, down to its 640 px floor. That is CSS, not here:
 *      it grows from a zero basis and never shrinks, so it simply takes what
 *      is left. This function reserves the floor and no more.
 *   2. the sources panel, down to 336. It is the panel a reader opens to
 *      check a citation, while the navigation panel is where the
 *      conversation is steered from.
 *   3. the navigation panel, down to 400 — the width it had before anybody
 *      dragged it. Nothing gives below its floor, and a window narrower than
 *      the floors is the undesigned range under 1280.
 *
 * It is pure, and it is what `aria-valuenow` on the separator reports: a
 * value that says 480 while the panel is drawn at 400 is a lie told to the
 * one reader who cannot see the difference.
