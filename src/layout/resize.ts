/**
 * How wide a panel may be dragged, right now, in this window.
 *
 * Two limits, and both are real:
 *
 *   the model's own bounds — 400–480 for the navigation panel, 336–560 for
 *   the sources panel — which are the widths the design was drawn for;
 *
 *   and what is left in the window once the OTHER panel and the answer
 *   column's 640 px floor have had theirs. A drag takes its room from the
 *   answer column and from nothing else. It could take it from the other
 *   panel instead — `fittedWidths` gives the sources panel away first when
 *   the WINDOW runs short — but a reader dragging one edge and watching the
 *   opposite edge move would be watching the app do something they did not
 *   ask for. Widening the navigation panel past what is free means narrowing
 *   the sources panel first, by hand, which is a second deliberate act.
 *
 * The two can cross: at 1440 with both panels open, everything is already on
 * its floor and there is nothing to drag. `min` wins then, and the separator
 * reports a value it cannot move away from, which is the truth.
