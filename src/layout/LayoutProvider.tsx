 *
 * Collapse and the document filter survive a reload, in `localStorage`. See
 * persistence.ts for what is kept and what is deliberately not. A caller that
 * hands in `initialLayout` is saying exactly what it wants to see, and is not
 * overruled by what the browser remembers.
 *
 * It also holds the pieces of state that two views have to agree on and
 * therefore neither can own: the active citation, the document filter, and
 * the sources behind the answer on screen. See citationContext.ts,
 * filterContext.ts and answerSourcesContext.ts.
 *
 * And it owns one rule about the window: below `bothSidebarsMinViewport` only
 * one sidebar can be open at a time, so opening one collapses the other.
 * Decision 2026-09-14, option B. It lives here rather than in CSS because it
 * changes collapsed state, which the buttons report; see useNarrowViewport.ts.
